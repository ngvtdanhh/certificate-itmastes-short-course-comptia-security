# 🌐 Network Security

Protecting network infrastructure from threats and unauthorized access.

## 🔒 Secure Network Design
- **Segmentation** – Isolate network segments with VLANs or subnets.
- **DMZ** – Buffer zone between internal and external networks.
- **Zero Trust** – "Never trust, always verify."

## 🛡 Security Devices
- **Firewall** – Control incoming/outgoing traffic.
- **IDS/IPS** – Detect and/or block malicious activity.
- **VPN** – Encrypt traffic for remote connections.

## 🧾 Protocol Security
- Prefer **SSH** over Telnet.
- Use **HTTPS** instead of HTTP.
- Disable insecure protocols (e.g., FTP, SMBv1).
